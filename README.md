# 💫 About Me:
 I'm Samed Metin Yat, a fourth-year Statistics student at Gazi University with a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence. My primary focus is on Computer Vision, but I am also broadly interested in AI advancements and their applications. I enjoy exploring Image Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI-driven automation.

I was working on Web Development with technologies like Django, Reactjs and done basic level websites. After working on several hobby kinda projects with Reactjs (like cloning gmail web page) I started working on Machine Learning. Learned many models and worked with them (XGBoost, Catboost etc.).

Currently my focus is production-ready AI apps and 3D Reconstruction.
